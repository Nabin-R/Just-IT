"Variable Scope "

# The scope of a variable is the section of the program where the variable can be accessed and modified.
# A variable declared in the main part of the program can be accessed globally by all subroutines. 
# It cannot be modified unless you explicitly state that the program should modify the global variable. 

"Global scope and Local scope"
# Variables can either have global scope or local scope. 

"Global scope"
# Global scope refers to a variable that can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program, even from inside subroutines. 


"Local scope"
# Local scope refers to variables that can only be accessed and modified within the code block that they were declared.  


"Handling Variable Scope"
# Not all programming languages handle scope in the same way Python has been designed to discourage the modification 
# of global variables, youâ€™ll find out why during this lesson.
# Variables are local unless otherwise declared. 


"To Do: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"

"Global variable"
# This variable has a global scope
globalNum = 5

# The subroutine localSubRoutine () is accessing the globalNum variable and displaying it as output. 
def localSubRoutine():
    # Access the globalNum variable declared outside of this subroutine
    print(f"Printed globalNum variable {globalNum}from outside of local subroutine\n")
    localNum = 10  # local variable that is declared inside localSubroutine
    print(f"Printed localNum variable {localNum} from local subroutine\n")


localSubRoutine()  # call subroutine
print(f"Printed globalNum variable {globalNum}from global\n")

"To Do: Task 1: "
"Uncomment the line of code with the print function below and then run the file only after you run and understand the code block above"
"The code below will attempt to access locaNum from loacalsubroutine"
#print(f"attempt to access locaNum from loacalsubroutine {localNum} \n")

"Can you explain the output from the terminal when you run the print statement above?"
#it will pass an error since u cannot get localnum till it has become a variable, it can only be accessed locally by the function not globally.
# to fix this u will have to either use a return value to fix it into a global variable
